        <p>
          Hi! I'm Barry. I'm 42 and live in Seattle. I absolutly love Halloween. The picture to the left shows me and my
          girlfriend at a pumpkin beer festival during October. Some of my hobbies include board games, photography, and
          filmmaking.
        </p>

        <p> 
          I have a B.A. Degree in Graphic Design from The International Academy of Design and Technology and an A.A. in
          Computer Electronics from ECPI. After I graduated ECPI I got a job as a Copier Repair Man. I then went on to
          work in printing for several years until I decided to go back to school and got my Graphic Design degree. I
          was hired by a merchandise company called BDA where I did Graphic Design, Photography, and Videography. Now I
          am a student at Code Fellows hoping to transition into a career in Software Development.
